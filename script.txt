---------------------------------------------

At any point in time there are 150 Maharathis across the world fighting against the forces of evil that plague the human world, the rakshasha. 
Once in a generation there is a Mahamaharathi born that is more capable than other divine warriors to stand up against the rakshasha. She is the Destroyer.


ENTER NICOLE'S HOUSE. GIRLS ARE TAKING OFF TRAINING SHOES. MAHARATHIS ARE SWEATING AS IF THEY HAVE BEEN EXERCISING OR TRAINING FOR SOMETHING. 

NICOLE: Hey, that was a really good session today. I feel like you've been pushing extra hard lately with both meditation and training. 

JESSICA: (shrugs) I don't know how to explain it, but it feels like something is building up. I have been feeling a lot of anger manifesting in the last few months.

NICOLE: Where have you felt it?

JESSICA: Sometimes I feel a swelling in the back of my lungs and my jaw clenching just walking down town or at the grocery store. I don't know where it's coming from, 
but it's growing. [JESSICA LOOKS OUT THE WINDOW]

NICOLE: You don't think they are here? Surely we would have felt them earlier on? And we would know who they are..

JESSICA: I don't know, maybe. It's been so long since one has been in this area. You haven't felt anything?

NICOLE: Not really anything beyond the frustration of training with Luke's new gadgets. Let's head over there after lunch. 

JESSICA: Burritos?

NICOLE: [NICOLE SCANS THE REFRIGERATOR AIMLESSLY -- TURNS BACK TO JESSICA] Burritos.

EXT SCENE. ENTER NEW SCENE AT LUKES SHOP. GIRLS WALK UP WITH HALF BURRITOS IN HAND.

LUKE: [WORKING ON GADGET -- LOOKS UP] Hi, y'all, burritos? Where's mine? [LOOKS OFFENDED]

Nicole tosses Luke a burrito wrapped in paper. 

NICOLE: Don't say we never did nothing for ya. How's the latest invention coming?

LUKE: [SIDE LAUGHS AS HE TEARS INTO THE BURRITO] Well, hard to say, because I don't know anyone to try it out.

JESSICA: [IRRITATED] C'mon, Luke, it's been a day. 

NICOLE: Yeah, we actually came by to talk about something serious, not just to feed you. Although I doubt there is a bottom to that stomach. 
We think there might be a Rakshasha in town. 

LUKE: [LUKE'S SMILE DEGRADES INTO SERIOUSNESS] Where?

JESSICA: We aren't sure, but lately I've been constantly on edge. My training has been emotional and unfocussed. Something has been pushing me to rage at random 
places in town, at the store, or in the library. Usually, in places where there is too many people to notice.

NICOLE: You didn't say it was that frequent earlier.

JESSICA: I'm saying it now. 

LUKE: How long has this been going on?

JESSICA: About a week or so.

LUKE: We need to visit every place that you have felt this way in the last week. We cannot be sure that it is a Rakshasha just yet, because, yes, they are masters of emotional
manipulation and persuasion, but so is our minds. In this day and age every human walks around with a war within them, confused by their own hypocrisy. They are ..."

NICOLE: [FINISHES LUKE'S SENTENCE]...Separated from themselves. 

LUKE: Exactly.

EXT SCENE.

---------------------

ENTER SCENE AT LIBRARY (MOSCOW PUBLIC LIBRARY). WALKING UP DETERMINED.

LUKE: Show me where you were.

JESSICA: This way. [LUKE AND NICOLE TO A TREE NOT FAR FROM THE LIBRARY ENTRANCE] I was meditating here. Trying to gather the ancestors energy for the upcoming spar with Nicole.
Then I started having these intrusive thoughts and memories that I haven't had in years. 

NICOLE: Perhaps we should try meditating together, as a group to try and channel the energy in this area? 

LUKE: Yes, good thinking. 

THE THREE SIT DOWN ON THE GRASS TO MEDITATE. QUICKLY THE WORLD BEGINS TO FALL AWAY AS THEY ENTER THE NOTHING STATE. 5 SECONDS PASS.

PETER: Hey, Nicole, is that you?! [MAN WALKING UP QUICKLY TOWARD NICOLE]

THE MEDITATION FOCUS IS BROKEN AND NICOLE TURNS TO FACE THE STRANGER'S VOICE.

NICOLE: [A LOOK OF RECOGNITION] No way. Peter? I haven't seen you since college. [STANDS UP TO EMBRACE HIM]

PETER: [HUGS BACK AND AFTER RELEASING, SPEAKS] I'm in town for the next month or two visiting family who live in Palouse and I thought I would take a walk around the 
old stomping grounds. I just had lunch with our linguistics professor in fact. [LOOKS OVER AT LUKE AND NICOLE] 

NICOLE: [PIVOTS TOWARD JESSICA AND LUKE] Peter, these are my two closes friends Jess and Luke, you just came upon some quiet time we were having. [JESSICA AND LUKE NOD] 

PETER: So nice to meet you both... you picked a good friend here, she got me out of a lot of risky college situations. [SIGHS WITH AN AIR OF REMINISCING] 

LUKE: She is indeed delightful. How long have you been in town, Peter? 

Peter: Sometimes it feels like yesterday I got here, and sometimes it feels like I never left. [TURNS TO NICOLE] I know you were taking some time to yourselves, so don't let me 
takeany more of your time, I have a hard time keeping down the noise of my own demons. [TOUCHES NICOLE'S SHOULDER] Let's get brunch or lunch or food sometime, yeah?
[GIVES ANOTHER LIGHT HUG] 

NICOLE: Sure, just shoot me a text. 

PETER: Awesome, can't wait. See ya. Nice to meet you both. [WALKS AWAY WAVING]

NICOLE TURNS BACK TO LUKE AND JESSICA WHO ARE LOOKING SKEPTICAL

NICOLE: Whattt? [SAID NONCHALANTLY]

JESSICA: I've never heard you talk about someone named Peter from college. 

NICOLE: That's surprising. It probably never came up, since we only talk about select topics.

JESSICA: It felt weird to have him come upon us like that randomly while we were trying to channel our energies.

NICOLE: What are you insinuating? 

LUKE: I think what Jessica is so passively alluding to is that your friend's arrival was serendipidously.

JESSICA: Yes, and I'm also saying that I didn't get good vibes off of him. 

NICOLE: I've known Peter for years, and people come in and out of town all the time. I know you are, but you shouldn't be suggesting that he is the potential Rakshasha. 

JESSICA: I'm am saying that it is a potential. You're probably right that he's not, but in these times of uncertainty, I am not taking my chances with such trust.

NICOLE: But you trust me, so why don't you trust my judgment here?

LUKE: Gals, for now, let's give him the benefit of the doubt until we have more evidence. Let's try to come back together and refocus. 

EVERYONE SETTLES BACK DOWN ONTO THE GRASS. JESSICA AND NICOLE ARE VISIBLY TENSE. RESUMING MEDITATION. EXT SCENE.

---------------------

ENTER JESSICA AND LUKE AT PARK, CODING PEOPLE FOR SADNESS. 

LUKE: Remember to remark upon their face, excessive sadness is an indication that a rakshasha is near.

JESSICA: Yes, Luke, I remember the training. 

LUKE: Hey, don't be sassy, just pay attention.

HOURS PASS. SCANNING PARK. MAN WALKING DOG. WOMAN DOING CARTWHEELS. MAN PLAYING CHESS. PETER COMES IN FROM FAR FIELD. HE PASSES CHESS PLAYER. MAN BEGINS TO ARGUE WITH HIMSELF

JESSICA: Wait, look. It's Nicole's weird friend. [LUKE LOOKS OVER] Peter just passed by that man who was playing chess by himself.. seemingly normal... but look at him closely.. he is furious and yelling at himself. [MAN KNOCKS OVER BOARD]

JESSICA AND LUKE'S BINOCULARS FOLLOW PETER AS HE PASSES A MOTHER WITH HER CHILDREN. ONE OF THE KIDS STARTS CRYING. 

JESSICA: See! We have to tell Nicole.

LUKE: Let's go back to the house and get some gear first. 

EXT SCENE.

---------------------

ENTER SCENE. BACK AT LUKE'S WORKSHOP THEY SEE THAT NICOLE LEFT A NOTE SAYING THAT SHE WENT OUT TO HUNGA DUNGA BREWERY WITH PETER. JESSICA AND LUKE LOOK DETERMINED, POISED 
AND READY TO FIGHT

LUKE: We have to go find her now. [GRABS GUN]

JESSICA: [GRABS SWORD] Let's go kill this loser.

EXT SCENE.

---------------------

ENTER SCENE. FRIDAY NIGHT - DOWNTOWN NICOLE IS WAITING ON CORNER IN CASUAL FORMAL ATTIRE, LOOKING DOWN AT HER PHONE. PETER APPROACHES AND NICOLE LOOKS UP.

PETER: Hey, sorry, I'm late. I had some last minute commitments that just couldn't wait. I'll by the first drink?

NICOLE: You'll buy the first two. 

PETER: Fair.

PETER AND NICOLE GO INTO THE BREWERY [HUNGA DUNGA] AND SIT AT A TABLE.

NICOLE HELPS JESSICA AND LUKE BACK UP AND THEY SHARE A KNOWING LOOK. 

JESSICA: I know it's hard to see passed the things we want to be true and see the things that are. I'm so happy you're safe.
