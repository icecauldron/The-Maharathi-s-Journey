---------------------------------------------

At any point in time there are 150 Maharathis across the world fighting against the forces of evil that plague the human world, the rakshasha. 
Once in a generation there is a Mahamaharathi born that is more capable than other divine warriors to stand up against the rakshasha. She is the Destroyer.


ENTER NICOLE'S HOUSE. GIRLS ARE TAKING OFF TRAINING SHOES. MAHARATHIS ARE SWEATING AS IF THEY HAVE BEEN EXERCISING OR TRAINING FOR SOMETHING. 

NICOLE: Hey, that was a really good  session today. I feel like you've been pushing extra hard lately with both meditation and training. 

JESSICA: (shrugs) I don't know how to explain it, but it feels like something is building up. I have been feeling a lot of anger manifesting in the last few months.

NICOLE: Where have you felt it?

JESSICA: Sometimes I feel a swelling in the back of my lungs and my jaw clenching just walking down town or at the grocery store. I don't know where it's coming from, but it's growing. [JESSICA LOOKS OUT THE WINDOW]

NICOLE: You don't think they are here? Surely we would have felt them earlier on? And we would know who they are..

JESSICA: I don't know, maybe. It's been so long since one has been in this area. You haven't felt anything?

NICOLE: Not really anything beyond the frustration of training with Luke's new gadgets. Let's head over there after lunch. 

JESSICA: Burritos?

NICOLE: [NICOLE SCANS THE REFRIGERATOR AIMLESSLY -- TURNS BACK TO JESSICA] Burritos.

EXT SCENE. ENTER NEW SCENE AT LUKES SHOP. GIRLS WALK UP WITH HALF BURRITOS IN HAND.

LUKE: [WORKING ON GADGET -- LOOKS UP] Hi, y'all, burritos? Where's mine? [LOOKS OFFENDED]

Nicole tosses Luke a burrito wrapped in paper. 

NICOLE: Don't say we never did nothing for ya. How's the latest invention coming?

LUKE: [SIDE LAUGHS AS HE TEARS INTO THE BURRITO] Well, hard to say, because I don't know anyone to try it out.

JESSICA: [IRRITATED] C'mon, Luke, it's been a day. 

NICOLE: Yeah, we actually came by to talk about something serious, not just to feed you. Although I doubt there is a bottom to that stomach. 
We think there might be a Rakshasha in town. 

LUKE: [LUKE'S SMILE DEGRADES INTO SERIOUSNESS] Where?

JESSICA: We aren't sure, but lately I've been constantly on edge. My training has been emotional and unfocussed. Something has been pushing me to rage at random 
places in town, at the store, or in the library. Usually, in places where there is too many people to notice.

NICOLE: You didn't say it was that frequent earlier.

JESSICA: I'm saying it now. 

LUKE: How long has this been going on?

JESSICA: About a week or so.

LUKE: We need to visit every place that you have felt this way in the last week. We cannot be sure that it is a Rakshasha just yet, because, yes, they are masters of emotional manipulation and persuasion, but so is our minds. In this day and age every human walks around with a war within them, confused by their own hypocrisy. They are ..."

NICOLE: [FINISHES LUKE'S SENTENCE]...Separated from themselves. 

LUKE: Exactly.
