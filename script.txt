---------------------------------------------

At any point in time there are 150 Maharathis across the world fighting against the forces of evil that plague the human world, the rakshasha. 
Once in a generation there is a Mahamaharathi born that is more capable than other divine warriors to stand up against the rakshasha. She is the Destroyer.


ENTER NICOLE'S HOUSE. TAKING OFF TRAINING SHOES. MAHARATHIS ARE SWEATING AS IF THEY HAVE BEEN EXERCISING OR TRAINING FOR SOMETHING. 

NICOLE: Hey, that was a really good  session today. I feel like you've been pushing extra hard lately with both meditation and training. 

JESSICA: (shrugs) I don't know how to explain it, but it feels like something is building up. I have been feeling a lot of anger manifesting in the last few months.

NICOLE: Where have you felt it?

JESSICA: Sometimes I feel a swelling in the back of my lungs and my jaw clenching just walking down town or at the grocery store. I don't know where it's coming from, but it's growing. [JESSICA LOOKS OUT THE WINDOW]

NICOLE: You don't think they are here? Surely we would have felt them earlier on? And we would know who they are..

JESSICA: I don't know, maybe. It's been so long since one has been in this area. You haven't felt anything?

NICOLE: Not really anything beyond the frustration of training with Lukes new gadgets. Let's head over there after lunch.
