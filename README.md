# The Maharathi's Journey
A Buffy Legacy.
Adya is a 12 year old girl living in the Indore Province of India. After Adya's Ritu Kala Samskara or her coming of age ceremony following her menarche, she begins to have visions of past lives that can come to her in her dreams or rip her from real time into past realities. Over the next six months, her parents, who are extremely concerned with public image and saving face, grow concerned that Adya's quasi-mental breaks will give their family a bad reputation for being mentally ill. In response to this, they send her to a mental facility for 3 years to try and rehabilitate her. A few weeks after arrival, she meets a Tibetan Vedic "seer", Virupaksa, from Bengal who visits the facility to guide the patients toward recovery and healing.
