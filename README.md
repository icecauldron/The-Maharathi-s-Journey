# The Maharathi's Journey
A Buffy Legacy.
Adya is a 12 year old girl living in the Indore Province of India. After Adya's Ritu Kala Samskara or her coming of age ceremony following her menarche, she begins to have visions of past lives that can come to her in her dreams or rip her from real time into past realities. Over the next six months, her parents, who are extremely concerned with public image and saving face, grow concerned that Adya's quasi-mental breaks will give their family a bad reputation for being mentally ill. In response to this, they send her to a mental facility for 3 years to try and rehabilitate her. A few weeks after arrival, she meets a Tibetan Vedic "seer", Virupaksa (Viru), from Bengal who visits the facility to guide the patients toward recovery and healing. Underneath his stern, but cordial, disposition, Viru has ulterior motives for working at the mental facility. Years earlier, he had a vision that "the destroyer" would enter this facility and would require his guidance to defeat the man-eating Rakshasa. A mythos in their own right, but very real to Viru, the rakshasas are described in Hindu mythologies thus.. "Rakshasas were most often depicted as shape-shifting, fierce-looking and enormous creatures, with two fangs protruding from the top of the mouth and having sharp, claw-like fingernails. They are shown as being mean, growling like beasts, and as insatiable man-eaters that could smell the scent of human flesh. Some of the more ferocious ones were shown with flaming red eyes and hair, drinking blood with their palms or from a human skull (similar to representations of vampires in later Western mythology). Generally they could fly, vanish, and had maya (magical powers of illusion), which enabled them to change size at will and assume the form of any creature. The female equivalent of rakshasa is rakshasi.[2](WIKI)". Viru meets Adya after a few weeks of her residency and instantly recognizes her as "the destroyer". 

After convincing Adya of her destiny, Viru spends the next 3 years training Adya in the martial arts of Mardani Khel [Created by the Maratha. Uses the patta (sword) and vita (corded lance)], Lathi Khela [Practiced in West Bengal and Punjab], and  Kalaripayattu [Oldest martial art in India - Uzhichil or the massage with Gingli oil, Otta, Maipayattu or body exercises, Puliyankam or sword fight, Verumkai or bare-handed fight etc.].
